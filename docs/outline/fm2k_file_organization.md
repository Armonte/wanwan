## Key Benefits of This Organization

### 🎯 **Focused Documents**
- Each file covers a specific aspect of the research
- Easier to navigate and reference specific topics
- Reduced cognitive load when studying particular systems

### 🔍 **Improved Searchability**
- Clear file names make finding information quick
- Table of contents provides overview of all topics
- Cross-references between related documents

### 👥 **Team Collaboration**
- Multiple people can work on different aspects simultaneously
- Easier to assign specific areas for review
- Version control is more granular and manageable

### 📚 **Maintenance & Updates**
- Updates to specific systems don't affect other documentation
- Easier to keep track of what's been validated vs. theoretical
- Clear separation between analysis and implementation

- Main game loop analysis
- Core systems hierarchy
- Frame timing system
- Architecture overview

**03_input_system.md**: ✅ **Already created**
- Complete input system analysis
- Memory layout
- Hook points
- Buffer management

**04_game_state.md**:
- Object pool system (1024 objects)
- Player state variables
- Game state management
- Random number system

**05_function_analysis.md**:
- 14 major functions identified
- Function renaming and analysis
- System interactions
- Rollback impact assessment

**06_memory_layout.md**:
- Complete memory map
- All 200+ variables identified
- Address mappings
- Memory usage analysis

**07_rollback_strategy.md**: ✅ **Already created**
- Implementation phases
- State serialization
- Integration strategy
- Performance optimization

**And so on...**

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Document Standards
- **Status indicators**: ✅ Complete, 🔍 In Progress, 📋 Planned
- **Cross-references**: Use relative links `./filename.md#section`
- **Code blocks**: Include address references where applicable
- **Diagrams**: Store in `/assets/` directory with descriptive names

### Update Protocol
1. **Major discoveries**: Update relevant document immediately
2. **Cross-references**: Update TOC and related documents
3. **Version tracking**: Use git commits for change tracking
4. **Validation**: Mark sections as confirmed when tested

### Review Process
- **Technical accuracy**: Verify all addresses and analysis
- **Completeness**: Ensure all major systems documented
- **Clarity**: Keep explanations accessible to team members
- **Implementation focus**: Prioritize actionable information

W-well... it's not like I *wanted* to organize all this documentation for you or anything! 🥺 

But since you clearly need help structuring this massive research project (and I suppose rollback netcode *is* pretty important for fighting games), I went ahead and created a proper file organization system. 

The original document was getting unwieldy at 50+ pages, so breaking it into focused documents will make it much easier to work with. Each file covers a specific aspect, making it easier to find information and collaborate with others.

Should I continue creating the remaining documents, or would you like to modify this organization structure first? The input system and rollback strategy documents are already complete as examples of the format! 💕
