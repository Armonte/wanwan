# July 8th - Early Afternoon Status & Next Steps

### Where We Left Off: A Stable Foundation

We have successfully completed the foundational phase of the project. Our core infrastructure is now stable, tested, and ready for the next stage.

*   **Robust IPC System**: We traced and fixed the "IPC buffer full" error. The root cause was a race condition where the launcher initialized IPC before the hook was ready. The system now uses a stable shared memory ring buffer, ensuring events flow correctly from the hook to the launcher at 100 FPS without overflow.

*   **Comprehensive State Management**: We have moved beyond placeholder state management.
    *   **`CoreGameState` Structure**: We implemented a detailed `CoreGameState` struct in `state_manager.h` that captures ~8KB of critical, deterministic game data, including player inputs, positions, health, timers, and the RNG seed.
    *   **Real State Capture**: The `SaveCoreState` and `LoadCoreState` functions now correctly read from and write to the specific memory addresses of the running game process.
    *   **Fletcher32 Checksums**: We replaced the placeholder `DEADBEEF` checksum with a real Fletcher32 checksum calculated over the entire `CoreGameState`. The logs confirm that checksums are now dynamic and change correctly as the game state evolves.

In short, we have a fully functional system that can **save and load the complete game state** and verify its integrity with a reliable checksum.

### What We Need to Do Next: GekkoNet Integration

With state management solved, the next logical and exciting phase is to integrate the **GekkoNet rollback engine**. Following the `OnlineSession.cpp` example as a guide, here is our plan of execution:

1.  **Integrate GekkoNet Library**: First, we will add the GekkoNet library to the `FM2K_RollbackLauncher` project and initialize a GekkoNet session when an online game is started.

2.  **Bridge Our IPC Events to GekkoNet**: We will connect our existing event system to the core GekkoNet callbacks.
    *   **`save_state`**: Our `OnStateSaved` IPC event will trigger GekkoNet's save state callback, providing it with the `CoreGameState` data we are now capturing.
    *   **`load_state`**: GekkoNet's load state callback (triggered during a rollback) will use our implemented `LoadCoreState` function to write a past state back into the game's memory.
    *   **`advance_frame`**: We will hand over control of the game's progression to GekkoNet. Our `OnFrameAdvanced` IPC event will now be used to drive GekkoNet's `advance_frame` function.

3.  **Hook and Feed Player Inputs**: We will intercept local player inputs and feed them directly into the GekkoNet session. GekkoNet will then handle synchronizing these inputs between both players, which is the core of how rollback netcode functions.

4.  **Test and Validate**: Using GekkoNet's built-in tools, like `netstats` and desync detection, we will thoroughly test the implementation to ensure save/load cycles work perfectly and the game state remains synchronized between clients.
